# morse_code_read_textfile_from_microSD

## here is a simple way to learn morse code

### this arduine nano project reads the content of text files stored on microSD cards and sounds the text as morse code

#### this also includes an LCD display to follow along as the morse code is sounding

any text file can be stored on microSD card and 'listened to' 

the inspiration for this project was from a ham radio operator K4FON who has a brilliant morse code trainer app

he includes a feature to converd morse code text to mp3 files and instructions of how to download books to text file.

I found it difficult to slow down, speed up, change the tone/pitch of the morse code without converting an entire file to mp3, so I found a way to change settings on the fly explained in this repository

this is a starting point to make this project

I hope to include more of the code that I have accumulated for this subject soon

## I am interested in expanding this project to sort out an app or applet to brows the web or open up emails and listen to the content in morse code
